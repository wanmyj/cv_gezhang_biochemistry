% Note: each section of this table (Education, Awards, Publications etc.) is 
% stored in a two-column table. The left-hand column is narrow (1 inch) and is 
% meant to store dates. The right-hand column is wide (5.2 inches) and stores 
% the main text.  Sections in which each entry might have multiple lines 
% (e.g., Education) are stored in a 'SectionTable' environment). Sections in 
% which each entry might just have one line are stored in a 'SectionTableSingleSpace'
% environment. The only difference between the two environments is the line 
% spacing between each entry. Both environments take one argument, which is the
% title of the section. See main document for how these environments are used.

\textbf{The role of X in thrombopoiesis and platelet granule secretion} \newline
Mentors: Si Zhang (Fudan University). \newline
1.The mechanism of platelet count increase caused by the loss of X: We found that the loss of X resulted in increased proliferation and higher maturity of megakaryocytes, thus generating more platelets through flow cytometry, transcriptome sequencing, WB and other methods.
2. The loss of X leads to reduced release of platelet particles : We found by flow cytometry and ELISA that the absence of X resulted in significantly reduced platelet particle release
3.We found that X interacts with follitin by IP and mass spectrometry, which was further verified by IP and immunofluorescence. By constructing truncated bodies, and by protein structure simulation, we identified the domains in which they interact.
4.Explore the role of X in chemotherapy: We explored the relationship between the degree of platelet activation and x expression in clinical chemotherapy patients. In addition, we further injected chemotherapy drugs into mice to explore the correlation between megakaryocyte proliferation, platelet count, activation and chemotherapy drugs in mice. \\

2018 -- 2021 &
\textbf{The role of Sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2) in platelet activation and its clinical significance} \newline
Mentors:  Si Zhang (Fudan University). \newline
1. Weakening of thrombus formation in vivo due to SMS2 Deficiency：our results clearly indicate that SMS2 plays an
important role in thrombosis and hemostasis through FeCl3-induced thrombus formation in mouse mesenteric and tail bleeding.
2. I performed notify obligation of informed consent and collected blood samples. \\

2020 -- 2021 &
\textbf{Activation of Platelet NLRP3 Inflammasome in Crohn’s Disease} \newline
Mentors: Si Zhang (Fudan University). \newline
1.The role of NLRP3 inflammasome in Crohn's patients was determined by analyzing the blood routine data of healthy people and Crohn's patients, and by detecting the expression and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in platelets and the production of ROS in platelets.
2.I completed the manuscript. \\

2015 -- 2018 &
\textbf{Methylation and serum response factor mediated in the regulation of gene ARRDC3 in breast cancer} \newline
Mentors: sheyu Lin (Nantong University). \newline
