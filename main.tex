% Note: each section of this table (Education, Awards, Publications etc.) is 
% stored in a two-column table. The left-hand column is narrow (1 inch) and is 
% meant to store dates. The right-hand column is wide (5.2 inches) and stores 
% the main text.  Sections in which each entry might have multiple lines 
% (e.g., Education) are stored in a 'SectionTable' environment). Sections in 
% which each entry might just have one line are stored in a 'SectionTableSingleSpace'
% environment. The only difference between the two environments is the line 
% spacing between each entry. Both environments take one argument, which is the
% title of the section. See main document for how these environments are used.

2018 -- 2021 &
\textbf{The role of X in thrombopoiesis and platelet granule secretion} \newline
Mentors: Si Zhang (Fudan University). \newline
1.Investigated the mechanism of platelet count increase due to deficiency of X: Conducted analysis using various techniques including flow cytometry, transcriptome sequencing, and western blot to determine the effect of X deficiency on megakaryocyte proliferation and maturity. Results showed increased proliferation and advanced maturity of megakaryocytes, leading to elevated platelet count.
2.The deficiency of X causes a decrease in platelet particle release: Through flow cytometry and ELISA analysis, it was determined that the loss of X resulted in a significant decrease in the release of platelet particles, including ---alpha--- granules, dense granules and lysosomes.
3.Flotillin-2's interaction with X was determined: Interaction between X and flotillin-2 was confirmed through IP by anti-X antibody and mass spectrometry analysis, which was further verified through IP by anti-flotillin-2 antibody and immunofluorescence experiments. The interacting domains were identified through truncated body construction and protein structure simulation.
4.  Investigated the impact of X on chemotherapy: This section investigated the correlation between platelet activation and X expression in clinical chemotherapy patients. Furthermore,  the effects of chemotherapy drugs on megakaryocyte proliferation, platelet count, and activation were explored in mouse models.  \\

2018 -- 2021 &
\textbf{The role of Sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2) in platelet activation and its clinical significance} \newline
Mentors:  Si Zhang (Fudan University). \newline
1.Weakening of thrombus formation in vivo due to SMS2 deficiency: Our results demonstrate the significant role of SMS2 in thrombosis and hemostasis as evidenced by FeCl3-induced thrombus formation in mouse mesenteric and tail bleeding models.
2.Adherence to informed consent protocols was maintained and blood samples were collected. \\

2020 -- 2021 &
\textbf{Activation of Platelet NLRP3 Inflammasome in Crohn’s Disease} \newline
Mentors: Si Zhang (Fudan University). \newline
1. Investigated the assembly of platelet NLRP3 inflammasome in patients with active Crohn's Disease (CD) and its correlation with platelet hyperactivity. Real-time PCR, western blot, flow cytometry (FCM), ELISA, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence experiments were conducted to uncover the results. Results suggest that the ROS-NLRP3 inflammasome-interleukin-1 beta--- axis may contribute to platelet hyperactivity in active CD.
2. The manuscript was completed through a comprehensive analysis and interpretation of relevant data.  \\
